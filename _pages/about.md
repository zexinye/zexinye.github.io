Hi, this is Zexin Ye (叶泽心), welcome to my website!

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at The Ohio State University.

My research interests lie in Industrial Organization, with a focus on algorithmic collusion. I combine tools from game theory and reinforcement learning to understand how autonomous pricing algorithms interact in competitive environments.

I am on the job market for the 2025-26 academic year.
